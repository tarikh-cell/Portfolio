The module involved several client meetings where we got the opportunity to present our research, prototype, and gain insights into a career in software engineering. As part of our assignment, we were also tasked with creating UML diagrams, producing functional and non-functional requirements, and using design patterns like the singleton pattern and model-view controller. One of the most valuable skills I gained through this was working as part of a team â€“ discussing ideas, valuing others' opinions, and learning as well as helping others."} />
